## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The actual form validation was pretty straight forward as I have done this a couple of time already. The layout was also simple.

### Continued development

As I keep doing these form validation challenges, things seem to become easier. I was struggling at first but now I am starting to get it. I will continue practicing with more complex validation.
